    h1 Ask The Hypnotist:  How Hypnosis Works

    p Hypnosis is a natural state of mind. Past misconceptions and myths about hypnosis are disappearing as hypnosis is helping people in many areas including medicine, dentistry, law enforcement, education and sports performance.
    p Many people do not realize the positive changes they can achieve with the help of a professional hypnotist. Here we will dispel many of the myths about hypnosis and answer the frequently asked questions.

    h3 How does hypnosis work? 
    p Our minds include the conscious and the subconscious. We like to think our conscious mind is in control as we live our lives, but the reality is that the subconscious mind determines most of what we do, including our habits. When you are in hypnosis, there is more powerful and effective communication with the subconscious mind.
    h3 How do I know if I'm hypnotized? 
    p Hypnosis is a natural state of mind that we drift in and out of in everyday life. One example is getting so into a movie that you don't notice that someone is calling for you. Or lying in bed in the morning in that state between waking and sleeping where you just drift. When most people are hypnotized, they feel very relaxed.
    h3 Is hypnosis safe? 
    p Hypnosis is totally safe. No one can make you do anything against your will. It is impossible to get stuck in hypnosis. Hypnosis is a relaxing, enjoyable and safe experience.
    h3 Will hypnosis work for me?
