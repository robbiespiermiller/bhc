    title: "Former Couch Potato Used To Say “I Hate Exercise” - Now She Enjoys Fitness!"
    quote: "When I began the program, the only physical activity I had was walking to the photocopier at work.  After 6 weeks of hypnosis I no longer binge eat, I look forward to exercise, I’ve lost 13 inches and 10 lb and completely transformed my perspective on life."
    cite: Melody K., Legal Assistant

    p Sit all day long, and you increase your risk of over 25 chronic conditions, including hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis.  

    p Doctors recommend a regular fitness routine for healthy weight management.

    p Let’s face facts.  Being a couch potato shortens your lifespan and puts your life at risk.  Many people take better care of their cars than their own bodies.

    p You know it’s time to get moving.  Whether you are a skinny fat person, or you really need to lose some weight, it’s time to start a fitness routine that works.

    p And you're probably rolling your eyes and saying:  "Yeah, yeah, I know all this.  But how do I actually do it?"

    p When you are fed up with disappointing yourself for not taking action, and you are worried about your health, hypnosis can help.
