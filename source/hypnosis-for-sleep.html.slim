    title: "Restless Sleeper Now Sleeps Well & Wakes Up Feeling Refreshed"
    quote: "When I first came here I was unable to fall asleep quickly and would awake several times through the night, waking up every day feeling drained and burnt out.  Now I can fall asleep much easier and stay asleep for the hours I need.  Waking up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day's challenges.  People around me notice a happier more relaxed person with much more energy.  Feeling much more at peace with myself and my surroundings.  Life's good."

I am happy to report that I slept like a baby throughout all my chemo sessions...it was wonderful to wake up refreshed knowing that as I slept my body was focusing on healing.

    h1 Sleep Better With Sleep Hypnosis

    p Do you feel tired after a sleepless night? Does your stress level contribute to not being able to sleep? Sleeplessness can be a never-ending cycle leaving you both tired and stressed for days to come. 

    p Hypnosis can help with sleep hypnosis. It is time to stop exhaustion from running your life and keep you from getting a proper rest. Sleep hypnosis will help you get a good night sleep naturally. We will help you learn how to sleep better for a happier, more relaxed and more energetic you.

    h3 How Can Sleep Hypnosis Help You?

    p Sleep hypnosis trains your mind to enter the state between waking and sleeping, called the hypnogogic state. This is a naturally occurring state of hypnosis. 

    p Many people who have trouble sleeping or staying asleep find themselves thinking or worrying while they are tossing and turning. You may worry about what time it is, or how you will function the next day when you are exhausted, or you may talk to yourself in your head about your worries or plans, or you may be frustrated or angry about not being able to fall asleep. This makes it even harder to fall asleep. 

    p You can learn how to choose your state of mind so that when it is time to sleep, you can drift off into sleep. Sleep hypnosis teaches you how to relax your mind and body and usher yourself into sleep by entering the relaxing state of hypnosis.
