    h3 A 10 year old boy waited outside the locked doors of a church breakfast program. The program was to start at 8:15 and the child stood outside at 7:15 in the dark, in the cold and alone. He explained he had not had any food on the weekend and was hungry. Could he please have some food? This child inspired the launch of Food4Kids. 

    p There are currently no other organizations addressing child hunger during the summer months. A summer Feeding program is even more critical, since school nutrition programs do not operate during summer months. Food4Kids fill this gap. From July 6 â€“ August 31, 2015, bins of healthy food are delivered to the homes of 500 children throughout Hamilton and Halton.
